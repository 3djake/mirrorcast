Mirrorcast - Open Source Solution to Screen Mirroring

This is a work in progress, the code is rushed, messy and not at all elegant at this stage.

The idea is to replicate what chromecast can do in regards to screen mirroring. 
Google chromes screen mirroring feature is very good when used with a receiver such as chromecast but this solution is proprietary.

Mirrorcast aims to do the same thing :-
	Low latency
	high quality video and audio 30fps (this part is why we do not use VNC)

To acheive this we will use existing FOSS software such as ffmpeg, ffplay and omxplayer
